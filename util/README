====================================================================
This directory is for files (typically code) that contain all
generally useful utilities.  A typical util function would be something
that would be used by multiple different directories and major code
blocks in the project (and hence it doesn't make sense for that code to
live in any particular block).  You should also check out the util
directories in other projects, as they might have something that you seek.


Note: you will probably want to 'git rm README' from this subdirectory
(*not* from the project root directory; that one is important for 
explaining the functionality of the package).  Removing this file will
respect the structure of the repo; it is here presently only to get 
you started.
